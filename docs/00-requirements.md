# Hardware requirements

At the time I'm writing this document, I have the following hardware:

- A Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB
- 2 Raspberry Pi 3B+
- 2 Orange Pi 5 16GB
- 2 NVMe SSD of 500GB
- 1 SSD USB 3.1 of 256GB

I'm using the Raspberry Pi 4B as my main server, and the other devices as nodes. The USB SSD will be plugged to the Raspberry Pi 4B, and the NVMe SSD will be plugged to the Orange Pi 5,
each one of them will be used as a system disk and a storage disk (there is enough space for both).
